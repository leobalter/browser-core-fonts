BrowserCoreFonts
================


BrowserCoreFonts is a very small project to turn easier checking out the browser core fonts. 

It consists in a single page with a reference table showing a text rendered on each of the fonts you can set in your page style via CSS.

You can notice there´s a enormous list of fonts you can natively use in your browser without using a special font via font-face.

Also, you can easily change the rendered text, font color, background color and tell your web designer about the uncountable possibilities he´s got to keep your HTML light without many resources. 

Keep it simple, keep it small, try those fonts before using other webfonts via font-face. I´m not even considering if you still use other fonts without font-face, it´s worse than marquee.

Oh! You can always try BrowserCoreFonts via our Github page: http://estantevirtual.github.com/BrowserCoreFonts

Free to share.
